# Next.js & Notion Blog

> Blogs are powered by with Next.js and Notion.
> 
> Inspired by [Travis Fischer's repo](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit)

## Intro

This repo is what I use to power my [personal blog](https://ngocpham1994x.vercel.app)). 

My [portfolio site](https://ngocpha1994x.github.io) is developed through github.io.

It uses Notion as a CMS, [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

I have been using Notion for documenting my daily life, and I am amazed by how easy and flexible Notion is. I thought about using Notion API to build my personal blogs, but I came across [Travis's repo](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit) and it's awesome.
